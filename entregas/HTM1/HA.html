<p>HA001<br>Effect of the isolation technique, donor age and cell passage on the proliferation rate and phenotype of stem cells from dental pulp<br> Turrioni APS*, Fernandes AM, Xu Y, Morse L, De-souza-Costa CA, Hebling J, Battaglino R<br>Cl&iacute;nica Infantil - UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL PAULISTA - ARARAQUARA. <br>E-mail: pops_turrioni@yahoo.com.br<br>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of donor age, cell isolation technique and passage number on the proliferation rate and phenotype of dental pulp stem cells (DPSC). Pulp tissue was obtained from six molar teeth of healthy persons (16-60 years of age), and divided into two parts. DPSC were isolated using either enzymatic digestion (ED) or explant (EX) technique. To study the proliferation rate of different cell passages, it was determined the number of days needed for the cells to reach confluence. Immunophenotyping was performed for the 2nd, 5th and 8th passages, by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis using antibodies specific for nestin (+), vimentin (+), CD44 (+), CD146 (+), Oct3/4 (+) and CD34 (-). Data from flow cytometry were subjected to ANOVA and t-tests (p&lt;0.05) and a desirability test was applied using a response optimizer. DPSCs presented a high proliferation rate from passages 2 to 5, while cells from passage 7 proliferated at a slower rate. For all markers, it was observed no statistical difference among passages, irrespective of the technique used or the donor&rsquo;s age. The mean fraction of specific antibody-reactive cells was 75&#37;, 50&#37;, 80&#37;, 45&#37;, 65&#37; and 2&#37; for CD44, OCT, Vimentin, Nestin, CD146 and CD34, respectively. The optimal desirability value, considering all positive markers, was obtained using ED technique and cells from younger subjects (d= 0,92).<br>It was concluded that neither isolation technique, donor age or cell passage significantly interfered on stem cells phenotype and proliferation rate.

<p>HA002<br>Novel easy-intracanal-adaptable 3D-Triple antibiotic paste mimic scaffold  as an antimicrobial strategy for regenerative endodontics<br> Albuquerque MTP*, Azabi A, Kamocka MM, M&uuml;nchow EA, Gregory RL, Valera MC, Bottino MC<br>Odontologia Restauradora - UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL PAULISTA - S&Atilde;O JOS&Eacute; DOS CAMPOS. <br>E-mail: terezapedrosa@hotmail.com<br>A novel three-dimensional triple antibiotic paste mimic scaffold (3D-TAPs) is proposed as a drug-delivery strategy for regenerative endodontics. Polydioxanone (PDS) polymer solution alone and loaded (35 wt.&#37;) with metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and minocycline were electrospun into 3D fibrous scaffolds. The fibers were evaluated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mechanical testing, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). <i>Actinomyces naeslundii </i>(ATCC 43146) were centrifuged to induce intra-tubular biofilm formation in a human root dentin slice model (1 mm thickness and 2.5 mm<sup>3</sup> canal orifice). The infected slices (n=16) were exposed to 3D-TAPs (~3.3 mg of each drug), TAP solution (50mg/mL of each drug), and pure PDS (drug-free). Biofilm elimination was quantitative and qualitative analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and SEM, respectively. FTIR data demonstrated that the antibiotics were successfully incorporated into the submicron fibers. 3D-TAPs demonstrated significantly lower mechanical properties than PDS (p&#8804;0.040). A dense penetration of <i>Actinomyces naeslundii </i>biofilm was observed by CLSM throughout the dentinal tubules. 3D-TAPs significantly reduced the percentage of viable bacteria compared to PDS (p&lt;.05). TAP solution completely eliminated viable bacteria without differing from 3D-TAPs. SEM images showed similar results to CLSM.<br>Collectively, the proposed easy-intracanal adaptable 3D-TAPs holds biological and clinical potential as a disinfection strategy prior to regenerative endodontics.

<p>HA003<br>Glide path management with two different mechanical systems in curved mandibular molars: an <i>ex vivo</i> micro-ct study<br> Kirchhoff AL*, Mello I, Cunha RS<br>Programa de P&oacute;s Gradu&ccedil;&atilde;o Em Odontologia - PONTIF&Iacute;CIA UNIVERSIDADE CAT&Oacute;LICA DO PARAN&Aacute;. <br>E-mail: dentalison@hotmail.com<br>Securing a reproducible glide path prior to instrumentation is recommended to maintain the original geometry of the root canal system and to prevent file separation. Mechanical glide path management systems have been introduced to expedite this step and multi and single file systems are available. The aim of this study was to compare apical transportation, volume increase and working time during glide path management with ProGlider (PG) and PathFiles (PF). Forty curved mesial canals of mandibular molars were evenly allocated into two experimental groups (n = 20) according to the glide path management system: PG or PF. Glide path was achieved according to the manufacturers'' protocol. Micro-computed tomographic analysis was performed in order to assess apical transportation at 1, 3 and 5 mm and volume increase. The time required to achieve the glide path was measured.  No significant difference was found in apical transportation between the PF and PG in all levels assessed (p &gt; .05). Comparisons made among the levels occurred as follows for both groups: 1 mm &#8805; 3 mm > 5 mm (p &lt; .05). Significant increase in volume occurred after mechanical glide path management in both groups (p &lt; .05). No significant difference in volume was found between PG and PF (p > .05). Significant difference in the length of time needed for glide path management was found between PG and PF (p &lt; .0001).<br>Both apical transportation and volume increase occurred during glide path management with PG single-file and PF multi-file systems, with no difference between them, however PG achieved glide path faster than PF.<br></p>

<p>HA004<br>Transcriptomic analysis of Bifidobacteria in root caries<br> Dam&eacute;-Teixeira N*, Parolo CCF, Maltz M<br>Odontologia Preventiva e Social - UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL. <br>E-mail: nailedame@hotmail.com<br>Bifidobacteria is regarded as caries-associated organism due to its aciduricity, although little is known about its metabolism in its natural site. This study aimed to evaluate the gene expression profiles of Bifidobacteria present in sound root surface biofilms (SRS) and in root caries (RC). Root surface biofilms were collected from 10 volunteers for the SRS group. Carious dentin was collected from 30 volunteers with active RC. Bacterial RNA was extracted and cDNA libraries were prepared and sequenced. Sequence reads were mapped to 255 strains, including 6 Bifidobacteria (B. kashiwanohense, B. thermophilum, B. breve, B. dentium, B. longum ss. infantis, B. longum). Count data were obtained and normalized to obtain gene expression (GE) and differential expression. Bifidobacteria presented low gene expression in both groups (transcripts= 5.1&#37; and 28.1&#37; in SRS and RC, respectively). B. kashiwanohense had the highest GE for both groups. It was found 1,062 genes with differential expression (foldchange>2; p&lt;10-3), all of them up-regulated in RC, except for the one that encode alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C in B. longum ss. infantis. Genes that encode 16S ribosomal RNA, TetR family transcriptional regulator, ABC transporter permease and macrolide ABC transporter ATP-binding protein showed the highest differential expression (foldchange>10.0; p&lt;10-3). There was high differential expression for genes coding for transport proteins.<br>Results suggest limited functions of bifidobacteria in root surfaces biofilms in both, carious and sound surfaces. A higher gene expression in root caries than in sound root surfaces biofilms were observed.

The resistance of <i>Candida</i> spp. biofilms to medications may be associated with the protective effect of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The aim of this study was to characterize the biofilms ECM of fluconazole-susceptible and -resistant <i>Candida albicans</i> and<i> Candida glabrata</i> strains. Single-species biofilms of <i>C. albicans</i> ATCC 90028 (fluconazole-susceptible- CaS), <i>C. albicans</i> ATCC 96901 (fluconazole-resistant- CaR),<i> C. glabrata</i> ATCC 2001 (fluconazole-susceptible- CgS) and <i>C. glabrata</i> ATCC 200918 (fluconazole-resistant&ndash; CgR) were grown in RPMI medium at 37&ordm; C for 48 h. Biofilms were processed for evaluation of colony forming units (CFU), total dry weight, and ECM components (water-soluble polysaccharides, alkali soluble polysaccharide, proteins and extracellular DNA - eDNA). Data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Games-Howell post-hoc test (&#945; = 0.05). Significant differences were found for CFU (p&lt;0.001): CaS (6,84&#177;0,20 log<sub>10</sub>), CaR (7,06&#177; 0,14 log<sub>10</sub>), CgS (7,25&#177; 0,19 log<sub>10</sub>), CgR (7,69&#177; 0,19 log<sub>10</sub>). No significant differences (p&gt;0.05) were observed for the other parameters tested. Interestingly, the most prevalent ECM component was eDNA (~22.7 &#0181;g/mg of total dry weight).<br>The biofilms ECM of fluconazole-susceptible and -resistant <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>C. glabrata</i> strains are similar, and eDNA is its major component. eDNA may confer negative charge to the ECM, thus, should be considered when designing biofilm control strategies.<br></p>

Thirty patients with CKD undergoing to hemodialysis therapy (12.3 years old &#177; 3.5) were recruited (HD). Blood and saliva were collected before (HD-B) and after (HD-A) hemodialysis. For the healthy group, 40 subjects (13.03 years old &#177; 3.2) were selected, only saliva was collected. Dental caries and calculus were evaluated. <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra of biofluids were acquired and processed on a Bruker 600 MHz Advance spectrometer. The Partial Least Squared discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and multilevel PLS-DA (M-PLS-DA) were used for multilevel statistical analyses, &#967;2 for clinical data, the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests (p &lt; 0.05) to evaluate each metabolite. The caries status was similar between the healthy (dmft 0.67 &#177; 2.1, DMFT 0.90 &#177; 1.7) and HD (dmft 0.87 &#177; 2.2, DMFT 0.79 &#177; 1.3) groups (p = 0.49, &#967;2). HD group presented higher prevalence of calculus (p &lt; 0.001). The M-PLS-DA distinguished the metabolomics profile between HD-B and HD-A, PLS-DA showed slight difference between saliva from HD-A and healthy group. There was a reduction in the levels of creatinine in blood and saliva after the hemodialysis (p &lt; 0.05). Metabolites such as choline, TMAO, and urea also reduced in blood after HD, and presented a slight decreasing in saliva.<br>It is possible to conclude that HD procedure change the metabolites in blood and similar alterations were observed in saliva.

<p>HA008<br>Effects of photobiomodulation on the masseter of children with spastic cerebral palsy: a pilot study<br> Santos MTBR*, Pedrique B, Silva KJ, Ortega AOL, Maciel SC<br>UNIVERSIDADE CRUZEIRO DO SUL. <br>E-mail: drsantosmt@yahoo.com.br <br>This longitudinal study on 20 children with spastic type cerebral palsy (CP), followed by the Association for the Care of Disabled Children (Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o de Assist&ecirc;ncia &agrave; Crian&ccedil;a Deficiente, AACD), evaluated the effect of photobiomodulation laser on the thickness of their masseter muscles. The Laser Group (LG) comprised 10 children with complaints of mouth opening restriction and difficulty in performing oral hygiene; the non-Laser Group (nLG) comprised 10 children with no restriction. LG was submitted to six infrared laser applications: LED, low intensity, As-Ga-Al, at &#955; = 808 &#177;3 nm, 120 mW, by MMOptics Twin Flex Evolution laser; using 10.0 J/cm2 of energy/dose and 20 s of exposure/site, at 7-day intervals. Masseter muscle thickness was evaluated using ACUSON X300 ultrasound equipment (SIEMENS). LG was assessed before any application and after six sessions, while the nLG was assessed twice, at 7-day intervals. The t tests for dependent and independent samples were used, at a 5&#37; significance level. The groups were similar in sex and age, though differences (p=0.003) were verified for the clinical form of CP; LG with tetraparesis showed greater values. The thickness of the right masseter before (8.9 &#177;2.1) and after (9.9 &#177;2.9) six laser applications differed significantly (p=0.039), as did the left (9.1 &#177;1.9, 9.7 &#177;1.6; p=0.023). Masseter muscle measurements of nLG and LG after six weeks showed no significant difference (right: p=0.484; left: p=0.395).<br>Photobiomodulation has a positive effect, as verified by the increase in thickness of the spastic masseter muscles (Apoio: Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o de Amparo &agrave; Pesquisa do Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo - Processo 2014/15662-1)<br></p>

<p>HA009<br>The osteoprotective effect of estrogen receptor alpha in maxillary bone<br> Macari S*, Sharma LA, Szawka RE, Dias GJ, Silva TA<br>Cl&iacute;nica, Patologia e Cir - UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS. <br>E-mail: soraiamacari@hotmail.com<br>Introduction: Estrogen deficiency results in systemic bone loss. However, the contribution of estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) in maintenance of alveolar bone microarchitecture and underlying mechanisms were not defined yet. Methods: 8-10 weeks old females and males homozygote ER&#945;+/+ (wild type - WT) and ER&#945;-/- (ERKO&#945;) mice were submitted to mechanical loading-induced bone remodeling by using an orthodontic appliance to promote tooth movement (OTM). The maxillary bone samples were analysed using microCT, qPCR and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Bone marrow cells (BMC) from WT and ERKO&#945; mice were isolated and differentiated in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Results: Both female and male ERKO&#945; demonstrated an osteoporotic phenotype in the femur and vertebrae. Maxillay alveolar bone loss and OTM were significantly augmented in ERKO&#945; mice and associated with decreased calcium percentage levels and increased expression of IL-33 in the periodontium. In vitro osteoclasts and osteoblasts differentiation was significantly higher in BMC from ERKO&#945; than WT mice.<br>In conclusion, we provided herein evidence for the first time that estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) is important to maintain the microarchitecture and control bone remodeling of maxillary alveolar bone. ER&#945; also protects femur and vertebrae from bone loss, either in female and male mice. ER&#945; effects might be related to local production of IL-33, but seems independent of RANK/RANKL. ER&#945; has yielded osteoclastogenisis down-regulation which contributes to bone protection. (Apoio: CAPES - PDSE5623/13-8)<br></p>

<p>HA010<br>Effect of bioactive primers on dentin-adhesive interface<br> Sousa ABS*, Bedran-Russo A, Pires-de-Souza FCP<br>Materiais Dent&aacute;rios e Pr&oacute;teses - UNIVERSIDADE DE S&Atilde;O PAULO - RIBEIR&Atilde;O PRETO. <br>E-mail: bia_abss@hotmail.com<br>Recently, it was reported that the degradation of dentin matrix by metalloproteinases (MMPs) could affect the adhesive interface stability. Thus, searching for better results in the longevity of adhesive restorations, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of bioactive primers (chlorhexidine - CHX, grape seed extract - GSE, doxycycline - DOXY) on bond strength (BS) of resin composite restorations submitted to load cycling (LC). For this, cavities were performed in 48 healthy human molars. Then, it was separated into 4 groups according to surface treatment received after the acid etching: GI - Control (Adhesive System, AS); GII - CHX 0.2&#37; + AS; GIII - GSE 15&#37; + AS and GIV &ndash; DOXY 3&#37; + AS. After, the samples were separated into 2 subgroups: A - Control and B - Submitted to LC. Then, the specimens were submitted to microtensile test and <i>in situ</i> zymography. Assay of collagenase/gelatinase and gelatin zymography were also performed. According to the statical analysis (2 &ndash; way ANOVA, Tukey, p&gt;.05 - SPSS), BS values were not influenced by the use of bioactive primers and by LC (p&gt;.05). In situ zymography analysis demonstrated that the bioactive primers decreased the activity of MMPs compared to GI (p&lt;.05). GI showed the highest value (p&lt;.05), while no differences was found in the groups treated with bioactive primers (p&gt;.05). Assay of collagenase/gelatinase and gelatin zymography showed that bioactive primers were able to inhibit MMPs, considering CHX less efficient.<br>In conclusion, the bioactive primers could be used in restorative procedures once they did not affect the BS values and decreased the MMPs activity.

<p>HA011<br>A new perspective of bonding agents<br> Nicoloso GF*, Antoniazzi BF, Soares FZM, Rocha RO<br>UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SANTA MARIA. <br>E-mail: nikoloso_sma@hotmail.com<br>This study evaluated the bond strength of the adhesive Scotchbond Universal applied either in etch-and-rinse or self-etch strategies compared to Adper Single Bond 2 and Clearfil SE Bond in two different conditions of dentin (sound and demineralized) commonly observed in minimal invasive restorations. Forty-eight sound human third molars had mid-coronal dentin surfaces exposed by removing the occlusal third. Twenty-four molars were submitted to pH-cycling to create demineralized dentin, and the other half remained intact until the bonding procedure. Eight groups (n=6) were created according to the adhesives tested and conditions of the dentin. After bonding procedures, a composite core was build-up to a height of 4-5mm and then was sectioned perpendicular to the adhesive interface in order to obtain rectangular sticks (0.8 mm2) that were submitted to microtensile tests (1mm/min). Two-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey&acute;s test (&#945; = 0.05) were performed as statistical analysis. Lower bond strength values were obtained to demineralized dentin (p=0.000), irrespective of the adhesive/strategy evaluated. Scotchbond Universal in both strategies evaluated had similar bond strength values to both compared adhesives (p=0.07). A higher number of premature failures (ptf) were observed in groups that the bonding procedure was performed in demineralized dentin.<br>The new &lsquo;universal&rsquo; adhesive can be used in both strategies, irrespective of the substrate, without the concern of jeopardize the restorative procedure to perform minimal invasive resin composite restorations.<br></p>

Experimental adhesives with Bis-GMA/TEGDMA, 75/25 wt&#37; and CQ/EDAB/DPIHFP 1 mol&#37; as photoinitiators were formulated. Halloysite Nanotubes (HNT), functionalized or not with 1:1 Triclosan (TCN), were incorporated into the adhesive at 5, 10, and 20 wt&#37;, totalizing 7 groups with one control group without filler addition. Groups were evaluated by Knoop hardness and softening in solvent, surface free energy (SFE) using optical tensiometer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polymerization kinetics and degree of conversion (DC) using FTIR spectroscopy, mineral deposition after artificial saliva immersion using Raman spectroscopy (965 cm<sup>-1</sup> - PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> peak), and antimicrobial activity against <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>. SFE and Knoop hardness increased with higher amount of HNT. TEM showed the presence of TCN particles in the inner and outer surfaces of HNT. The DC(&#37;) of HNT/TCN 5 (55.37 &#0177; 0.87), 10 (57.12 &#0177; 0.06), and 20 wt&#37; (55.97 &#0177; 0.91) increased significantly (p &lt;0.05) comparing to control group (48.50 &#0177; 1.13). Polymerization rate decreased with TCN-doped HNTs. As the HNT content increased, mineral deposition increased for all groups after 14 days of immersion. Bacterial growth inhibition was found with HNT/TCN 20 wt&#37;.<br>Addition of HNT with TCN at 20&#37; to adhesive resin was able to promote antimicrobial activity and mineral deposition without compromising chemical mechanical properties.

<p>HA013<br>Novel natural dentin biomodification agent from cashew nut shell and its application as monomer on dentin bonding<br> Feitosa VP*, Souza NO, Lemos MVS, Ogliari AO, Ogliari FA, Maia FJN, Oliveira DLV, Mazzetto SE<br>Odontologia Restauradora - UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO CEAR&Aacute;. <br>E-mail: victorpfeitosa@hotmail.com<br>The aim of this study was to assess the dentin biomodification of proanthocyanidins (PACs, gold standard) and that of cardol (extracted from the cashew nut shell liquid). Demineralized dentin bars were evaluated for the initial weight and elastic modulus by flexural test. The modulus was re-evaluated after bars immersion for 60s (n=10) in distilled water (control), 2&#37; PACs or cardol solutions. The samples were then stored in artificial saliva and the weight was re-evaluated after 1 and 4 weeks. The cardol was reacted with methacrylic acid to synthesize the new monomer CMA (cardol-methacrylate) which was purified and characterized with gas chromatography. In flat dentin surfaces from extracted molars it was applied phosphoric acid for 15s, rinsed and it was applied distilled water, solutions of PACs, cardol or CMA (2&#37; each) for 60s prior to the application of Singlebond Universal adhesive. The restored teeth were cut into sticks for the bond strength (&#0181;TBS) test. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (&#945;=95&#37;). The statistical analysis showed that the modulus variation was higher with cardol (338.2&#177;45.1&#37;) than with PACs (56.3&#177;5&#37;). The weight loss (degradation) with the use of PACs (38.6&#177;4.3&#37;) was higher than with cardol (21.5&#177;2.9&#37;). The &#0181;TBS was increased from 32.3&#177;4 MPa (control) to 41.9&#177;4.3 MPa by using PACs and 44.5&#177;6.5 MPa with cardol. However, the highest &#0181;TBS was obtained with CMA (52.3&#177;4.2 MPa).<br>Cardol has demonstrated to be an efficient alternative for dentin biomodification and its analog CMA may be used to significantly improve the bonding to dentin.

Pendulum impact device was developed to perform the tests with two different impact objects (Steel ball and baseball). Five bovine jaws were selected and received a 6 mm MTG. The impacts were performed with 90, 60 and 45&ordm;, with and without MTG. Strain gauges were attached at the lingual surface of the tooth that the impact was performed. Strain and shock absorption data were analyzed with 3-ANOVA and Tukey Test (&#945;=0.05). Six EVA specimens were made and subject to tensile test for elastic modulus (E) assessment. (E) of bovine enamel and dentin were calculated using a dynamic micro-hardness indenter. 2D finite element (FEA) models were created and a non-linear dynamic finite element impact analysis was performed. Baseball ball was modeled with experimental test and FEA. The mean [SD] strain values for the strain-gauge test (90, 60 and 45&#0186; ) were: 2562.6 [926.5], 1546.4 [304.8], 101.8 [37.8] for the steel ball/without-MTG and 45.2 [16.4], 40.9 [13.4], 37.6 [10.9] for steel ball/with-MTG. 101.7 [20.9], 73.5 [19.4], 59.9 [20.8] for the baseball ball/without-MTG and 26.7 [10.8], 23.7 [8.1], 21.5 [5.4] for the baseball ball/with-MTG. The FEA strain values followed the same pattern of the experimental strain-gauge test. MTG had a shock absorption reaching 90&#37;.<br>It was concluded that the impact velocity, impact object and the MTG presence affected the stress and strain. MTG presence is related to lower strain and stress. Strain-gauge test validated the FEA; thus the bovine model is suitable for MTG biomechanics evaluation.

Eluates corresponding to 72 hours of resin sample immersion in medium were prepared and exposed to cell line for 72 hours. Medium without samples served as non stimulated group. The cytotoxic effect from the eluates was evaluated using MTT assay with Chang conjunctival cells. The production of IL1&#946; (interleukin 1&#946;), IL6 (interleukin 6), TNF &#945; (tumor necrosis factor &#945;) and CCL3/MIP1&#945; (macrophage inflammatory protein 1&#945;) was evaluated by ELISA and, mRNA expression of COL IV (collagen IV), TGF &#946; (transforming growth factor &#946;) and MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinases 9), by RT-PCR. Data were submitted to ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test (p&lt;0.05). Different polymerization methods exhibited divergent biological behavior.<br>Microwave-processed resin showed slight cytotoxicity due to significant cell proliferation reduction and IL6 quantity increase. Higher mRNA expression of COL IV, MMP9 and TGF &#946; was verified by water bath resin, however this result was similar to the non stimulated group. (Apoio: FAPs - Fapesp - 2013/11830-4)<br></p>

<p>HA018<br>Electromyograph, bite force and quality of life during the adaptation of mandibular overdentures<br> S&ocirc;nego MV*, Guiotti AM, Pesqueira AA, Dekon SFC, Andreotti AM, Medeiros RA, Santos DM, Goiato MC<br>Materiais Odontol&oacute;gicos e Pr&oacute;tese - UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL PAULISTA - ARA&Ccedil;ATUBA. <br>E-mail: mah_vs@hotmail.com<br>Despite advances in preventive dentistry in Brazil, the number of edentulous individuals is still great. Many patients present difficulty when using conventional dentures, especially towards the mandibular one. A treatment option for these situations is the installation of implant-retained prostheses. Although this treatment is well established in the literature, there are no studies comparing what happens to muscles and quality of life of patients during the treatment. We selected 12 completely edentulous patients, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, to rehabilitate with mandibular overdentures retained by two dental implants and a complete denture as antagonists. We evaluated the efficacy of the treatment and its evolution in five distinct steps, initially with the old complete dentures (I) after the implants placement with the mandibular prosthesis relined (II) after the placement on of the healing abutments (III), after the installation and adaptation of new prostheses (IV) and after three months of its use (V). At each stage, we evaluated patients through the temporal and masseter electromyography (EMG), bite force and the questionnaire OHIP Edent to assess the quality of life of these patients. The results for EMG found a decrease in muscle activity during the mastication of raisins, rest and lateral movements, while the bite force and the quality of life of patients gradually improved during the study (p &#706; 0.05).<br>The rehabilitation with mandibular overdentures should become standard for edentulous individuals, the benefits of treatment are observed even before its completion.

<p>HA019<br>Oral manifestations of gastrointestinal diseases in patients treated at Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Services<br> Ribeiro GH*, Matte CAS, Grando LJ<br>Odontologia - UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SANTA CATARINA. <br>E-mail: guih_hr@hotmail.com<br>Gastrointestinal diseases-GID such as inflammatory bowel disease-IBD (Crohn''s disease-CD and ulcerative colitis-UC), gastroesophageal reflux disease-GERD and celiac disease-CeD may have harmful effects on teeth and soft tissues of oral cavity. This research aimed to study the stomatological impact of GID. Were evaluated 110 patients treated at Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Services in a hospital in Florian&oacute;polis. After patients&rsquo; consent, they underwent intra-oral clinical examination, answered the anamnesis and had their saliva collected for measurement of pH and salivary flow. Analysis of medical records was performed to examine history/evolution of the disease. We found 17 (15.5&#37;) patients had GERD, 31 (28.2&#37;) had CD, 27 (24.5&#37;) exhibited UC and only 5 (4.5&#37; ) had CeD. Most patients were female (58.2&#37;) and the age ranged from 17-79 years. IBD were most prevalent among women (CD-51.6&#37;, UC-66.7&#37;); in CeD all interviewees were women; GERD was more prevalent in men (52.9&#37;). The most commonly found alterations in these patients were tongue disorder (59,1&#37;), dry mucosa (21,8&#37;), candidiasis (12,7&#37;) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS&ndash;2,7&#37;). Dental erosion-DE was diagnosed in 22 patients, 6 of them had GERD. Referring to the degrees of DE, 76.1&#37; had no injury, 14.1&#37; exhibited grade 1, 8.7&#37; showed grade 2 and only 1.1&#37; had grade 3. Regarding saliva, 57.3&#37; had acid pH and 66.7&#37; had low flow.<br>It was found DE is related to GERD and was not related to acid salivary pH; RAS were prevalent in patients with IBD; tongue without papillae was present in CeD and and IBD.<br></p>

<p>HA020<br>Cell phone use and cytokines expression in saliva of the parotid salivary glands<br> Siqueira EC*, Souza FTA, Ferreira EF, Costa SM, Correia-Silva JF, Salom&atilde;o UE, Gomes CC, Gomez RS<br>UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS. <br>E-mail: elisadesiqueira@hotmail.com<br>The association between cell phone use and the development of parotid tumors is controversial. The radiofrequency waves emitted by cell phones penetrate exposed tissues, and energy absorption produces heat in the region of the parotid glands. Because there is unequivocal evidence that the microenvironment is important for tumor formation, molecular studies in healthy patients reveal early alterations in tissue homeostasis induced by cell phone use. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether cell phone use alters the expression of cytokines in the saliva of the parotid glands. We used the saliva produced by the parotid glands to assess cytokines levels, comparing the saliva from the gland exposed to cell phone radiation (ipsilateral) to the saliva from the opposite, unexposed parotid (contralateral) of each individual (n=166). We compared salivary flow, total protein, interleukin 1&#946; (IL-1 &#946;), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) between the ipsilateral and contralateral parotids. Our results showed decreased levels of IL-10 and increased of IL-1 &#946; in ipsilateral side (P&#8804; 0.05). No other difference was observed.<br>This is the first study to assess the association between cell phone use and cytokine levels in parotid glands saliva. We provide molecular evidence that the exposure of parotid glands to cell phone use can alter IL-10 and IL-1 &#946; cytokine levels. (Apoio: Fapemig - APQ-00349-11)<br></p>

<p>HA021<br>Antineoplastic effect of 15d-PGJ2 in multiple myeloma<br> Sperandio M*, Demasi APD, Martinez EF, Ara&uacute;jo NS, Araujo VC, Clemente-Napimoga JT, Napimoga MH<br>Patologia - FACULDADE DE ODONTOLOGIA S&Atilde;O LEOPOLDO MANDIC. <br>E-mail: marcelo.sperandio@slmandic.edu.br<br>Multiple myeloma (MM) is a multi-organ malignancy of plasma cells that can also manifest intraorally. It is characterized by a high protein-folding demand, which predisposes them to accumulation of unfolded proteins, resulting in oxidative stress (ROS). Unfolded protein response (UPR) and ROS response have been explored as therapeutic targets for MM. 15d-PGJ2 has emerged as a potent antineoplastic prostaglandin. In the present study we investigated its effect on MM both in vitro and in vivo. MM cells were cultured in RPMI. Cell proliferation, viability and drug toxicity were evaluated. ELISA was used to quantify the secretion of light-chain immunoglobulin. Glutathione (GSH) was quantified using a luminescence-based assay. The expression of UPR and ROS-related proteins was evaluated using q-PCR for PRDX1, PRDX4, GRP78, GRP94 and Western Blotting for PRDX1 and PRDX4. NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with human MM.1R cells and treated with 15d-PGJ2 at 4mg/Kg for 2 weeks (N=9). Tumour volume was recorded over the treatment period against the controls (N=7) and the aforementioned genes reassessed in vivo. 15d-PGJ2 showed higher cytotoxicity to MM cells than dexamethasone, which was associated with increased GSH. Additionally, all aforementioned genes and proteins were also upregulated, thus indicating that these cells were under UPR and ROS. Tumour growth rate was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) in the animals treated with 15d-PGJ2 when compared to the controls.<br>These data suggest that 15d-PGJ2 favours ROS and protein misfolding, especially threatening the survival of cells that have a high protein-folding load and/or are susceptible to ROS.

<p>HA022<br>Discriminant validity of self-report measures for periodontitis diagnostic<br> Cyrino RM*, Cortelli SC, Cota LOM, Costa FO, Cortelli JR<br>Periodontia - UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS. <br>E-mail: renata@renatacyrino.com<br>The objective of this study was to test the discriminant validity of periodontal self-reported measures, proposing a score to quantify periodontitis. A sample of 332 individuals was selected and answered a questionnaire containing 14 self-reported measures. Subsequently, it was subjected to a full-mouth periodontal examination, recording probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). Periodontitis was defined as: a) moderate - at least 2 interproximal sites with CAL&#8805;4mm or PD&#8805;5mm in different teeth; b) severe - at least 2 mm interproximal sites with CAL&#8805;6mm in different teeth and one site with PD&#8805;5mm; c) no disease/mild - any of the categories above. Factor analysis of the questionnaire generated 3 domains: 1) periodontitis history; 2) self-perception, signs and symptoms; 3) risk factors (KMO=0.681). From the obtained factor loadings, a constant was created for each self-reported measure, resulting in the formula for calculating the score of each domain and the total score of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was able to differentiate no disease/mild from moderate/severe disease (p&lt;0.001). Differentiation between moderate and severe disease was not achieved (p&gt;0.05). The canonical discriminant analysis showed the validity of domains 1 and 3 in the discrimination of no disease/mild from disease (Wilks'' Lambda p&lt;0.001 and p=0.001 respectively). Cross-validation indicated 60&#37; of cases correctly classified.<br>It was concluded that self-reported measures related to disease history and risk factors showed better discriminant validity.

<p>HA023<br>Gene expression and remodeling rate of peri-implant bone in osteoporotic rats due to anti-resorptive medications<br> Faverani LP*, Ramalho-Ferreira G, Polo TOB, Hassumi JS, Gomes-Ferreira PHS, Gon&ccedil;alves A, Okamoto R<br>Cirurgia e Cl&iacute;nica Integrada - UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL PAULISTA - ARA&Ccedil;ATUBA. <br>E-mail: leobucomaxilo@gmail.com<br>The aim of this study was to analyze the gene expression of bone repair markers and the rate of bone remodeling around implants in osteoporotic rats treated with antiresorptive medications. Eighty Wistar adult rats (n = 8) were divided into 4 groups (ovariectomized rats fed with low calcium content diet = Ovx; rats subjected to sham surgery ovariectomy and fed a balanced diet = Sham, ovariectomized rats treated with raloxifene = Ral, and ovariectomized rats treated with sodium alendronate = Ale. An implant surface modified by double etching-acid was installed in each tibial metaphysis and the euthanasia occurred according to the analysis performed [(42 days for molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction real time, 14 and 42 days for immunohistochemistry: osteoprotegerin expression - OPG and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand - RANKL); 60 days for fluorochrome analysis in confocal laser microscopy: calcein administration at 14 days and alizarin red at 42 days)]. The relative gene expression of OPG and Osteocalcin showed no difference between the groups Sham vs Ral and Ral vs Ale (Dunn test, p &lt;0.001), with the highest values for Ral, followed by groups Ale, Sham and Ovx. Regarding the rate of bone turnover, both immunohistochemistry (OPG and RANKL), and the quantification of fluorochromes bands at 14 and 42 days and gene expression of RANKL/OPG ratio, observed higher values for the Ale group (Test Dunn p <0.001).<br>Therefore, raloxifene response improved osseointegration in the bone tissue affected by osteoporosis, whereas alendronate decreased bone turnover (Apoio: FAPs - FAPESP - 2012/ 15748-8; 2012/15912-2 )<br></p>

<p>HA024<br>Biomimetic coatings enhance cellular responses and tribocorrosion behavior of cpTi surfaces<br> Marques ISV*, Alfaro MF, Ricomini-Filho AP, Cruz NC, Mesquita MF, Mathew MT, Sukotjo C, Bar&atilde;o VAR<br>Pr&oacute;tese e Periodontia - UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS. <br>E-mail: isabellamarques@gmail.com<br>Into the oral cavity, dental implants are submitted to a synergistic interaction of wear and corrosion (tribocorrosion), which may lead to implant failures. The objectives of this study were (i) to create and characterize bioactive titanium-coatings doped with Ca, P, Si and Ag produced by micro arc oxidation (MAO), (ii) to investigate the coating stability under tribocorrosion and (iii) to evaluate cellular responses of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on the anodic films. Samples were divided as a function of different Ca/P ratios and treatment duration (5 and 10 min). Non-coated and sandblasted samples were used as controls. Surface characterizations were conducted to understand surface properties. ANOVA and Tukey&rsquo;s HSD tests were used (&#945;=.05). Biofunctionalized porous oxide layers were obtained. Higher Ca/P produced larger porous and harder coatings when compared to non-coated group (p&lt;.001), due to the presence of rutile crystalline structure. The total mass loss (Kwc), mass loss due to wear (Kw) and that due to corrosion (Kc) were determined. The dominant wear regime was found for higher Ca/P groups (Kc/Kw &#8776; 0.05) and a mechanism of wear-corrosion for controls and lower Ca/P groups (Kc/Kw &#8776; 0.11). The group treated for 10 min and enriched with Ag presented the lowest Kwc (p&lt;.05). MAO treated samples improved the spreading, attachment and osteogenic gene expression levels of hMSCs.<br>The major highlight relies on the biofunctionalization of Ti-coatings with improved surface features, tribocorrosive behavior and cells responses, as very attractive for dental implants.
